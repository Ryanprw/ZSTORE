![Hema store project preview](./img/hema-store.png)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this project.
Hema Store is an online store that selling home furnitures. 

I made the design with Figma then write the code with HTML, Bootstrap 4 and Custom CSS. In this project I learn a lot about grid system in Boostrap 4 and some other CSS syntax that I never used before. 

If you see something in this application that I can improve please let me know. 
Feedback is always welcome.
